## 2016

2016 was a huge year for me. I decided to make a change to my life that was probably
the greatest and scariest I've ever considered.

Yet not much has *really* changed.

I changed my name, I adjusted my appearence but most of all, I changed my way of
seeing the world. I carried round this secret that would only ever rear it's head
when I was alone, something which I deemed so private that I went to great,
paranoia-driven lengths to ensure that no-one had any sort of inkling of the kind
of thoughts that had plagued me since I was young (I slipped a little
in my teenage years and told people some of these things when I was little more
care free).

The decision I took in 2016 was to tell the world my super secret stash of privacy.

It's been a wonderfully enlightening period; I no longer feel like I have a secret
to trudge around with. I assumed everyone carried round a secret and that's just how it was,
but apparently that was just one misconception out of many I had.

Yet, despite this extra rooma and freedom I allowed my brain to have, it still seems
to be endlessly plagued with "stuff". I find it increasingly difficult to switch off,
I get more obsessed with "things", I find it ever more difficult to get a sound night's
sleep, and I suffer more with social anxiety.

I've made some huge changes and I've given myself freedom, but in 2017 I want to actually
change the way I *live* in the world, because that hasn't changed.

### Switching off

I think my smart device started to consume me more than I was comfortable with last year.
I haven't been on Facebook for a while, but I really started to get into Twitter. I've
also been into politics, and Twitter was a fascinating place to view all the politic shift
that was happening. It was also a horrendously dark place overflowing with *a lot of stuff*.

I've told people I want to rid myself of my smart device. I carry it everywhere and it becomes
this little addictive thing that I just can't stop using. I like to think I have a good account
of self control, but my smart device I find very difficult to cut myself off from. Ideally, I'd like
to replace my phone with just a non-smart phone, but the reality is there are some functional uses
that I really would miss it for, and/or just have to replace with extra "stuff", so it doesn't
seem worth it. These are maps (for sat nav, I have very poor sense of direction), music (Spotify is my
music collection), BBC Radio iPlayer (I like to listen to stuff in the bath), Google Authenticator
and messaging apps (to ensure I still keep up some iota of a social life).

Everything else I have uninstalled where possible. I have disabled all notifications, and unless I'm
oncall I keep my phone on silent.

The key thing is that I use it for function and I do not let it become invasive. The invasiveness of
smart devices creeps up on you: install an app, and by default it notifies you about everything. That's
just additional information *that I do not need*. My brain would take it in regardless and then I
wouldn't be able to switch off.
