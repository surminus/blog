## Bad for my brain

Like many other privileged people in this modern world, I own and use a "smart"
device which has become an integral part of my everyday life.

I also work in technology, where I spend a very sizeable chunk of my life looking
and consuming a world presented and powered by screens and the internet.

But hey, this is modern life.

Or at least, this is what is driven and marketed to us. This is the future,
and you'd be mad to give up these conveniences.

The problem is, I'm convinced it's bad for my brain because it never allows me
to switch off. It's addictive; everyone admits that, but it's one of those
socially acceptable forms of addiction, like coffee.

People fill their uncomfortable or "bored" moments by engaging in their digital
world. Standing in a queue, in a lift, going to the toilet, sometimes even just
walking somewhere.

Why do we feel the need to fill that boredom?

## Mindfulness at rest

Mindfulness has become extremely popular, particularly using apps that use your
smart phone to help you through that mindfulness. I'm all for people finding
remedies that help them, and I can only think it's a positive influence, but
it's not for me (mostly because I am naturally a very drowsy person with low
concentration).

I've decided to find "mindfulness at rest": all the times of my life I should be spending
away from a screen.

I also don't have enough self control to let me carry a smart device with
me. It's just too tempting.

I've been meaning to give up my smart device for a while, and have been threatening
it to my poor colleagues and friends for some time, but never did, finding excuses in the conveniences
I'd leave behind.

Life eventually decided for me when my Google Nexus 6P finally gave up. I have a spare phone
capable of only phonecalls and SMS, which is now my main phone.

### "I have no sense of direction, so I can't give up Google Maps"

I'm going to learn how to navigate. Unbelievable.

### "I'll have nothing to listen to music on"

I'm pretty content not listening to music out and about. I can wait
until I'm back home and make it more of an event rather than a way to block out
the world.

I did do a totally hipster thing, and bought a Walkman, and that'll be useful
for sunbathing which I find an extremely soothing activity with music because the
music becomes the focus.

### "I need a 2FA device"

This is the most compelling reason to keep a smart device. Compelling,
but kind of saddening.

For the time-being, I'm taking a risk and using SMS where possible or storing codes
elsewhere.

### "Internet banking is really useful"

It really is, and it really helped me in keep in touch with my finances.

But there are other methods, and maybe I'll become less obsessive about money.

### "I won't have a camera"

If I get so desperate to take pictues I can buy a digital camera. I mostly only
take pictures of my cat, anyway, and she's getting fed up of the paparazi at home.

### "I won't be able to keep up to date with work email when I'm not at work"

Just kidding.

### "I won't be able to watch news about Donald Trump and Brexit unfold in real time"

Shame.

## Long-term consequences

I'm not sure how I will judge it helps yet, but I am convinced there are not enough
warnings for a trend I find extremely worrying.

My friend recommended [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00Z70VHQE/) to me which
I suggest everyone should give a go. At the very least, we should be absolutely
minimising the amount of time children spent on these kinds of devices.

My gut tells me that in 20 or 30 years we'll look back on our behaviour and wonder
how we ever thought it was anywhere close to healthy.
